svn (unreleased)
o Fixed a bunch of compile warnings on cygwin
o dnscat clients no longer crash (or behave oddly) if no DNS server can be
  found (ie, /etc/resolv.conf doesn't exist or doesn't have what we need)
o Move dnscat's signal handling and atexit() registration to after
  initialization, which prevents dnscat from trying to 
o Fixed a bug that would output the wrong sequence number for sequence number
  mismatches (thanks to Kos for reporting this one)
o When running Dnscat on Windows, calling the select() function when we only
  have pipes to listen for would cause an error because pipes are polled
  rather than selected. We now check for (and work around) this condition. 
o Update the Windows shellcode to proper handle fields, whether or not they
  exist. 
o Updated the Windows shellcode (both standard and stager) to, once again, 
  work properly.

0.05alpha2 [2010-07-06]
o Fixed a bugs where encoded packets' lengths would be one byte too long
o Removed some debug output statements

0.05alpha1 [2010-07-06]
o Added 'staging' code -- will now serve file given by --stage argument in
  TXT records
o Added a 'session' field that is tyically randomized
o Added an 'identifier' field that can be set to help identify connections
  (payloads, for example, use the identifier field)
o Significant refactoring, particularly the session code. The session code
  is no longer tied to DNS functionality and can potentially be used by other
  programs. 
o Created three variations of shellcode:
  - Standard Linux shellcode
  - Standard Windows shellcode
  - Stager Windows shellcode
  These shellcodes are currently in a state of flux, and haven't been tested
  as much as I would like.
o Added --multi argument to servers, which allows a server to handle multiple
  concurrent clients. 
o Removed the requirement to use --domain as an argument if --dns is given.
  This simplifies direct client->server (non-recursive) connections.

0.04 [2010-02-20]
o Basically a complete re-write
