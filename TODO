Note: Anything prefixed with a '*' is blocking the release of the next version. 

Before release:
  - Check the headers to make sure everything is consistent
  - Remove testing -D's from Makefile
  - Update the version number
  - Make sure -V works on everything
  - Create a branch
  - Builds
    - Linux static 32-bit -- Slackware 13
    - Linux static 64-bit
    - Windows 32-bit (check on 2000!)
    - BSD?
  - Note
    - Date
    - SVN Revision
  - Update documentation on the wiki
  - Write blog, Slashdot story, etc, watch the magic!

dnscat
  - Compression/encryption?
  - Add socket (relay) support on both ends
    - Listen/connect
    - Proxy (http/socks?)
  - Simulate "window" sizes
    - Ignore out-of-sequence packets
    - Send X packets, keep a count of how many are sent, lower count when acknowledged
  - Look at doing this over other protocols
    - ICMP
    - SMTP
  - On a client RST, don't necessarily kill the process. 
  - Add options to list/select system DNS servers
  - Can I run a Web server that streams the data (or outputs it to a textfile that's reloaded)?
    - Might want to look into a --datagram-only option for server if I do that.
  - Write a proper error function for closed/error sockets

NetBIOS stuff:
  - Explore the option of moving the NB-name-encoding deeper into dns.c. 
  - Can we do a bailwicked attack?
